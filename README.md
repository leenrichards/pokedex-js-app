# Pokédex JavaScript app

The objective of this small web application is to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to load
data from an external API and enable the viewing of a list of Pokémons, along with their characteristics.

# Design Considerations

The pokemon images are displayed upon loading the list of Pokekmon, in order to make the app more appealing to the end-user:

When viewing the pokemon details, coded-boxes depict the pokemon type. This makes for a cleaner and simpler way to display the retrieved pokemon information:

# Languages Used

This app was written using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and Bootstrap. It interfaces withj an external Pokemon API using AJAX.

# My Role

I was the interface designer and code developer for this app. I have learned how to render data via DOM interaction, load data from an external API, use JQuery when needed, integrate Bootstrap elements, and add ESLint rules to make my code consistent.
